Instructions on how to run Theseus' Quest

WASD are used to move the player (Red Circle) around the maze. The aim is to distract the Minotaur
(Brown Circle) to allow the children (Blue Circles) to escape. The player has three lives which will 
automatically close the application upon losing all three. This happens if caught by the Minotaur.

To run in debug the solution with the TheseusQuest folder can be opened. Within the main loop there is 
a boolean that can be changed as well as some commented code that can be used to show the triangles of
the NavMesh as well as the paths of both the A* path and the Smoothed Path.
